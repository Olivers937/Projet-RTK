## About the Project
RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) is a cutting-edge technology revolutionizing precision geolocation worldwide. Widely used in precision agriculture across Europe and North America, this technology enables farmers to optimize their operations with centimeter-level accuracy. It is also deployed in diverse fields, including smart construction, high-precision mapping, and autonomous driving.

As part of our training at Polytechnique Yaoundé, our group of 4th-year Computer Engineering students aims to adapt this technology to meet the specific needs of the Cameroonian community. Our project seeks to implement an accessible RTK system tailored to the local context, unlocking applications in agriculture, topography, and urban planning across Africa.

## Project Objectives
* Develop an affordable and accessible GNSS base network
* Provide precise geolocation solutions for local applications
* Contribute to technological innovation in our region
* Create a knowledge base for future generations of students

## Technological Context
RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) is a satellite positioning technology that achieves centimeter-level accuracy in real time. Our system incorporates:

* GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo signals
* A fixed base station
* Mobile receivers
* A real-time correction system

## Target Applications
Our solution can be applied in several critical domains for local development:

1. Precision agriculture
2. Urban mapping
3. Public works
4. Environmental monitoring
5. Topographic surveys

## Project Team
Our team consists of students passionate about technological innovation and committed to providing practical solutions to societal challenges.
